**Test considerations:**

There were a lot of things to change in the project. 
This was my first approach to mybatis and I wasn't sure how the implementation for it worked

**Left to do:**


Mybatis mapper and queries were unfinished, lacked enough time to research and implement.
The property validator is barely scaffolded, inside the different considerations for the endpoints would be applied
Unit tests were left unfixed, given more time I would mock responses and test the DB schema.
I would also add integration tests against the DB with test containers, API controller and service.
Given more time also I would have added Swagger and dockerized the application and database based on profiles.
